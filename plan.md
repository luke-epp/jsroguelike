# Making a roguelike in ts

### Tech
I want to make a 2d roguelike in typescript that I can ship to a .exe with electron or some other framework

### TODO 
- I want a menu screen with options, level select, character select
- I want gameplay that is fairly simple, it should just involve moving the character and making build decisions
- I want some kind of framework for drops, level up rewards, etc.
