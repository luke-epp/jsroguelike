You play as 1, who has lost their love, 2, to the alphabet.

Your starting item is 0, which lets you shoot 0 at letters

The big plot twist at the end is that your friend, factorial (!) is actually exclamation and is the final boss.

Difficulty levels are fonts, you unlock the next one by beating the previous level

waves of enemies get stronger every 30 seconds and turn into more of the next letter a -> b -> c, etc. 

elite enemies can be bold, underlined, or italicized

enemies sometimes drop mathematical and physical constants, these should always be presented to the user in special character format (greek letters)

around the world there are +, - , times, /, ^, these can be used to combine the constants you get into new numbers with new powers (always rounded to nearest integer), when you fight a boss or the first enemy will drop an equal sign, this can be used to spec into a new weapon

the equations can be put into any number of weapons:
one : base weapon, shoots projectile at nearest enemy
odds: shoots bullets up and down
evens: shoots bullet left and right
primes: aura around user
fibonacci: big arc at nearest enemy at close range
factorials: rapid fire laser at nearest enemy
squares: projectile with splash damage
cubes: bouncing projectile
biquadrates: slow attack speed piercing laser in direction character is facing

okay so far there is some cool stuff, but we need crazy synergies, crazy ways to have insane builds, but you really have to earn it and it has to be balanced.
Everything need to be situationally good and things need to be rare / hard / expensive in proportion to how objectively good they are. I am not sure what the easiest way to do this is while continuing with with math analogy

at level up you can spec into random math that occur in tiers, you are presented with 3 random numbers at each level up:
- if a number shares properties of a class it gets upgraded, for example you get two, that is even, prime, factorial, so it buffs all those clasess.
- Upgrades need to be quite a bit better based on the infrequency of them occurring
